So make sure to do it! Here are some ways to ask questions: The What if? Question: What if I were to…? What if I did…? This is an open-ended question that allows your client or prospect to answer in any way they choose. It can be used as a way of simply exploring an idea or solution with them, or as a way of putting forth an alternative proposal.</p>\n\n<p>**Answering objections with objections.<br>\n**When a client or customer says no to your product or service, they’re not always saying that you can’t be of help.

In general, an objection is a reply to any form of persuasive message that says no to what you’re saying. This could be in person or online, it could be expressed directly or indirectly.
